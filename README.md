basic hello world example
I am a 4th year student at whitewater, majoring in CS with a minor in MAGD. I've had some experience in developing video
games, and worked with pioneer game developer Scott Adams this past summer on a game that will be on the market by black friday 2018. 

I have experience in C++, C#, and other things.
